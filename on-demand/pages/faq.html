<h5>Can I use this while travelling or at the gym?</h5>
<p>
  Absolutely. Whether you’re at the gym, in a hotel room, or outside, just log
  in and press play. We’ve organized classes into helpful categories — like
  <i>Hotel Friendly</i> and <i>No Equipment</i> — so you can easily find options
  that suit your space, setup, and surroundings.
</p>
<br />

<h5>Do I need special equipment?</h5>
<p>
  Nope! Most classes use bodyweight or everyday items. When equipment is used
  (e.g., dumbbells, resistance bands, spin bikes), it will be listed in the
  class description.

<h3>Classes & Experience</h3>
<h5>What kinds of classes are available?</h5>
<p>
  You’ll find a range of formats including Spin, Train, Pilates, Barre,
  Recovery, and so much more! Whether you want to sweat, stretch, or slow down,
  there’s something for everybody.
</p>
<br />
<h5>Are classes beginner-friendly?</h5>
<p>
  Yes! Our classes are intentionally inclusive and scalable. You’ll find
  beginner, intermediate, and advanced options across all formats, with guidance
  and modifications offered throughout.
</p>
<br />
<h5>How often are new classes added?</h5>
<p>
  New classes drop regularly, so you always have something fresh to try. You’ll
  see a mix of formats, lengths, and instructor styles added each month.
</p>
<br />
<h5>
  Do On Demand classes count toward in-studio milestones or VERSŌ Rewards?
</h5>
<p>
  We’re here to celebrate all the ways you move, but On Demand classes don’t
  currently increase your class total.
</p>
<p>
  While you won’t earn points for taking On Demand classes, you will earn VERSŌ
  Rewards points when you purchase your On Demand subscription for the first
  time. It’s a one-time reward to welcome you to the platform and celebrate your
  commitment to moving with us — wherever you are.

<br />
<h5>Are there playlists or music in classes?</h5>
<p>
  Yes — music is a big part of every class at VERSŌ. Each session features a
  curated playlist that supports the energy, pacing, and vibe of the class. In
  formats like Rhythmic Spin, Rhythmic Row, and Rhythmic Train, music doesn’t
  just set the mood — it drives the tempo, guides your movement, and brings the
  entire experience to life.
</p>
<br />
<h5>Can I save or filter classes?</h5>
<p>
  Yes and yes! You can bookmark your favourites and filter by type, duration,
  instructor and/or equipment.
</p>

  library. A free trial is available so you can explore before committing.

    ></b

</p>
<br />

</p>
<br />

<h3>Special Considerations</h3>
<h5>Are there any prenatal or postpartum classes?</h5>
<p>
  We recommend checking with your healthcare provider before starting a new
  fitness program. Many of our classes offer options that can be safely modified
  during pregnancy or postpartum, and we’re working to expand these offerings in
  the future.
</p>
<br />
<h5>Are instructors certified?</h5>
<p>
  Yes. All Studio VERSŌ instructors are certified in their respective
  disciplines and trained to teach in a way that aligns with our inclusive,
  anti-diet approach to movement.
