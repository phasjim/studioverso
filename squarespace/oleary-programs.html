      <div class="prog-overlay">Our Rhythmic Spin classes focus on the tempo of the music. This determines our resistance and drives our movement. Expect challenging, but well-paced classes with choreography. In Metric classes, intensity targets and intentional intervals guide the pedal stroke pace and pressure. The Metric program is subdivided into three specific workout types: Power, HIIT and Endurance.</div>
